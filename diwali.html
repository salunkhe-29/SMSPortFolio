    <h1>STORY OF DIWALI</h1>
    <p><b>
        Once upon a time, in the beautiful kingdom of Ayodhya, there was a brave and kind prince named Rama.<br> 
        He had a lovely wife named Sita and a loyal brother named Lakshmana. One day, Ramaâ€™s father, King Dasharatha,decided to send Rama away to the forest for 14 years to keep a promise he made to his wife.<br>
        Without complaining,Rama,Sita,and Lakshmana left the palace and went to live in the forest.<br> In the forest,an evil demon king named Ravana heard of Sita's beauty and goodness. He wanted to make her his queen.<br>
        So, Ravana came in disguise and kidnapped Sita, taking her to his island kingdom, Lanka.<br> Rama was heartbroken, but he did not give up. With the help of his brother Lakshmana and an army of monkeys led by their clever king, Hanuman, Rama set out to rescue Sita.<br>
        After a long and fierce battle,Rama defeated Ravana and rescued his beloved wife.<br>
        When their exile was finally over,Rama,Sita,and Lakshmana returned to their kingdom of Ayodhya.<br>
        The people of Ayodhya were so happy to have their prince back that they lit rows of oil lamps, called diyas, to welcome them home.<br>
        The whole city glowed with lights, and everyone celebrated with joy, sweets, and fireworks.<br><br>
        This is why we celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights. It marks the victory of good over evil and light over darkness.
